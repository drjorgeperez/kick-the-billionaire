# Kick the Billionaire

This is a development mirror of the game [Kick the Billionaire](https://kickthebillionaire.com/). The intent of this project is to open collaboration for developing new ways to "kick the billionaire." The code is virtually the same, with the exception that all copyrighted models have been removed so only barebones meshes are visible (viewable by turning on DEBUG mode). Interested contributors can reference [CREDITS.MD](https://github.com/drjorgeperez/kick-the-billionaire/blob/main/CREDITS.MD) for a list of the original models and download them themselves.

Do not donate to any person claiming to be the organizer of this project. This project will forever remain free and open source. It is not about the money. It is about sending a message.

## Quick Start

1. Install node.
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory.
3. Use `npx vite` to run the app.
4. (Optional) Download the models referenced in [CREDITS.MD](https://github.com/drjorgeperez/kick-the-billionaire/blob/main/CREDITS.MD) and place them in the `public/models/props` folder to see them in the game.
